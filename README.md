# WhatsApp-GroupBot-Example

This project is an example on how to use my [WhatsApp-GroupBot](https://github.com/Yukaru-san/WhatsApp-GroupBot).<br><br>
I used this bot for myself a while ago and decided to make it public so people can get some inspiration on how to get started on programming their own.<br><br>
That being said I removed some of its features to protect the privacy of my contacts and users.

# Usage
Clone the program or download it as zip, adjust the parts of the source code that require a name of some group or contact and compile it.
